Hi, I’m Lindsay Stratton, a non-traditional technologist fascinated by data, curious to know why and how things work and could be made to work better; always looking for opportunities to think creatively, meet challenges, and share knowledge.

I'm interested in open source software, documentation writing, reading all the things, traditional needlework, creating mixed media assemblages, and bourbon.

I’m currently refreshing my git skills, and learning python and macrame.
